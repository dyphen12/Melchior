#### To Know:
The Mercadolibre's python "SDK" and their API has some credentials tokens that needs to be validated, Melchior it's not
prepared for this (just wait). You need to provide your ACCESS_TOKEN by yourself, just copy paste it into the Melicon.py script.

Mercadolibre updates your ACCESS_TOKEN every 6 hours, so take this in mind when developing or making a fork.
